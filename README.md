## About the Site

I am a full-stack developer with a passion for making things beautiful and making beautiful things. This site showcases my work in three areas: art, baking, and coding. My hope is that as I further develop my skills in digital design and CSS, it will be updated to better reflect the caliber of its contents in style and aesthetic.

### About the Tech

This site was built using a single page React app to display photo and detailed descriptions of my work.
